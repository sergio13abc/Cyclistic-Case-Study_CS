--About the Company

--Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering in 2016. Since then the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.

--Moreno the director of Marketing has set a clear goal: 
--  Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 
--  In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, and why casual riders would buy a membership.
--  How digital media could affect their marketing tactics.


--Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
--Summary of the Goal:

--Profitability of Annual Members: 
--  Cyclistic’s finance analysts have determined that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. 
--  This insight drives the company’s future success strategy.

--Conversion Opportunity: 
--  Rather than targeting new customers, Cyclistic aims to convert casual riders into annual members. 
--  These casual riders are already familiar with Cyclistic and have chosen the service for their mobility needs.

--Understanding Differences: 
--  To achieve this goal, the marketing team plans to analyze historical bike trip data. 
--  They seek insights into how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. 
--  Additionally, they want to understand why casual riders might consider purchasing an annual membership.
